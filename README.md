## 💌 Sorry & I Miss You

This is a small effort , I built this for my bestie. Recently, I left our group because of ..!!, Sorry I Can't Explain...But I realized ;how much I actually miss them. Instead of just sending a text, I wanted to do something a little extra to show how much they mean to me.

``` So, this is my way of saying: “I’m sorry, I miss you, and I hope we can make things right again.” 🫂✨  ```

``` I Miss You So Much ------------ Even i text You Daily 😂😂 ```
 ✨It doesn’t really matter if you reply or not 🙂… I’ll still message you every day, from 🌞 good morning to 🌙 good night. Just like we used to talk daily before 💌💭.


## 🌸 Why I made this

Sometimes words in chat don’t hit the same. I wanted to create something more meaningful, something that feels like a little digital hug. This website is my way of putting effort into an apology and making my bestie smile again.
